# Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour
# using input to compute gross pay. Pay should be the normal rate
# for hours up to 40 and time-and-a-half for the hourly rate for
# all hours worked above 40 hours. Put the logic to do the
# computation of pay in a function called computepay() and use the
# function to do the computation. The function should return a value.
